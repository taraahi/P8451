# Problem 1
### Reading in CSV file
```{r}
bcdata <- read.csv(file = 'bcdata_Assignment1.csv')
head(bcdata)

str(bcdata)
```

```{r}
var.names <- c("age", "bmi", "glucose", "insulin", "HOMA-IR", "leptin", "adiponectin", "resistin", "MCP-1", "Classification")
colnames(bcdata) <- var.names
str(bcdata)
```

### Cleaning data

It looks like the data is clean and the variable names are already at the column heads. The only step I've taken is to make the Classification variable a factor, as it's categorical.

```{r}
bcdata$Classification <- as.factor(bcdata$Classification)
levels(bcdata$Classification) <- c("Healthy Controls", "Breast Cancer Patients")
```

### Creating summary tables 

```{r}
summary_df = summary(bcdata)

knitr::kable(summary_df)
```
